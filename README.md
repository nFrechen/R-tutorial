# R-tutorial
This is a tutorial for [R](http://r-project.org) beginners who work with the graphical user interface [RStudio](http://rstudio.com). It is meant to be self explanatory. 

There are some tasks to do in it to test your understanding and to learn interactively. What you learn in the first steps you will need later on. This way you learn how to do more and more complicated tasks and repeat the stuff from the first lessons.

There is also a [German version](https://github.com/nFrechen/R-Tutorial-Deutsch) of this tutorial available.

**To start using this tutorial:**

*  dowload and install [R](http://cran.uni-muenster.de/) and [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (install R first and then RStudio).
*  [download all tutorial files](https://github.com/nFrechen/R-tutorial/archive/master.zip)
*  extract the ```.zip``` file wherever you want
* double click the ```R-tutorial.Rproj``` file to open RStudio.
* in the files panel of RStudio (usually on the bottom right)  open the first tutorial file ```L01 basics.R``` in the ```basics``` folder.
* all further instructions are in the file

**Note:**
To be able to properly read the tutorial text you should open the RStudio menu ```Tools > Global Options``` and in the section ```Code``` choose ```Soft-wrap R source files```. This way you don't have to scroll horizontal to be able to read all the text.
